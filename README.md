# Galactic Lions TeamCode - 2024-2025 IntoTheDeep Season
**Welcome to the Lakeview Robotics Code Respiratory! This space is primarily built for our dedicated programmers of our teams.**

This is a module that contains the Android Studio projects with code for our robotics teams' FTC robots for the IntoTheDeep season. It's based on the [original FTC SDK](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController). While meant primarily for our teams' members, [this respiratory](https://github.com/ftcteam5898/GalacticLions-Starter) should be welcoming to contributions from external organizations and FTC community.

## Requirements

To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio 2024.2.1 (codename Ladybug) or later.

To program your robot in Blocks or OnBot Java, you do not need Android Studio.

## Questions or Need Help?
Please ask/email one of the coaches or team captain.
You can also check the [FTC Documentation](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/).
